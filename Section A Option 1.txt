Positive Aspects:

Thank you for your submission, A great attempt to this task.  Your Work Is well commented and easy to follow.
You display a good understanding of working with dictionaries and the for loop.


Aspects That Could Be Improved:

Unfortunately, your program is not running as  expected and displaying the desired output. 
This is because of  Indentation and Spacing.
your code in line 2 should be indented under the main method, 
you did not pass any parameter in your sorted function as you pass while defining the method

while working in python , familiarise try to use snake_case for variable, method, and function naming.
Snake-shaped nomenclature uses underscore to widen the word distance, which is more clear and easy to read
The variable name of the camel hump nomenclature is compact, saving line width.

The other aspect to look into your program : there is no value parsed into the sorted() function.
You can parse the variable defined in the for loop.

Kindly note that your code does not contain any comments.
Comments helps the reviewer and other developers to understand and follow your code easyly
